Data: Paramater values to initialize the MCMC algorithm for each of the four SNEASY+CH4 models.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Notes: ,(1) These parameter values correspond to posterior mean values from previous model calibrations. This ensures the MCMC algoirthm starts in a region of high posterior probability.,,,,,
,"(2) The methane lifetime corresponds to either a constant lifetime (SNEASY-FAIR and SNEASY-FUND), or an initial condition for time-varying tropospheric lifetimes (SNEASY-Hector and SNEASY-MAGICC)",,,,,
,"(3) Not all models share the same uncertain methane cycle parameters (for example, SNEASY-FUND does not have a methane soil sink lifetime parameter).",,,,,
,"(4) For parameters without lower or upper bounds, a physically informed range was selected based on past calibrations (these bounds are only used to select an initial step size in the adaptive MCMC sampling algorithm).",,,,,
