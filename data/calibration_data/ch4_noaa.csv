# These data are made freely available to the public and the,,
# scientific community in the belief that their wide dissemination,,
# will lead to greater understanding and new scientific insights.,,
# The availability of these data does not constitute publication,,
# of the data.  NOAA relies on the ethics and integrity of the user to,,
# insure that ESRL receives fair credit for their work.  If the data ,,
"# are obtained for potential use in a publication or presentation, ",,
# ESRL should be informed at the outset of the nature of this work.  ,,
"# If the ESRL data are essential to the work, or if an important ",,
"# result or conclusion depends on the ESRL data, co-authorship",,
# may be appropriate.  This should be discussed at an early stage in,,
# the work.  Manuscripts using the ESRL data should be sent to ESRL,,
# for review before they are submitted for publication so we can,,
# insure that the quality and limitations of the data are accurately,,
# represented.,,

# RECIPROCITY,,
# ,,
# Use of these data implies an agreement to reciprocate.,,
# Laboratories making similar measurements agree to make their,,
# own data available to the general public and to the scientific,,
# community in an equally complete and easily accessible form.,,
"# Modelers are encouraged to make available to the community,",,
"# upon request, their own tools used in the interpretation",,
"# of the ESRL data, namely well documented model code, transport",,
"# fields, and additional information necessary for other",,
# scientists to repeat the work and to run modified versions.,,
# Model availability includes collaborative support for new,,
# users of the models.,,

# The uncertainty in the global annual mean is estimated using a monte carlo,,
"# technique that computes 100 global annual averages, each time using a",,
# slightly different set of measurement records from the NOAA ESRL cooperative,,
# air sampling network.  The reported uncertainties are the standard,,
# deviations for each annual average using this technique. Please see,,
